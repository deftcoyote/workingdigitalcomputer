A simple software version of the Comspace/Arkay CT-650, or paperclip computer

This is a simple web page version of the famous paperclip computer. It was originally described in the 1968 book "How to Build a Working Digital Computer" by Edward Alcosser, James P. Phillips, and Allen M. Wolk.

A more recent version was created by Michael Gardi here: https://hackaday.io/project/168833-wdc-1-a-working-digital-computer.
He extended the opcodes and created the machine by 3d printing most of the components in a modular setup. I have followed his opcode setup.

The goal of this project was to play with the machine and allow for the learning experience without having the physical machine.
